## Enable-devtools Spotify for Windows

Starting from version 1.1.80.699, access to devtools was limited, this script turns on devtools forcibly, after restarting the client, it is highly likely that the script will need to be restarted.

Just download and run [Enable-devtools.bat](https://cutt.ly/bGYVkFd)
